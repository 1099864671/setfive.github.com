<h3>Election Day - Who is winning what states?  What does Twitter have to say?</h3>
<p>At about midnight today we decided it may be interesting to see what states are voting what according to monitoring twitter.  We've written a few algorithms that parse many of the posts to twitter for certain content, to determine if people are stating they are supporting a candidate or if they voted for a specific one.  As the states get darker red or blue, you can see who Twitter is saying is going to win the state.  So far we have recorded <span class='count'>32</span> inputs from twitter.</p>

<p>Since we did write this in about 2 hours, we can't promise that it is accurate, but thought it'd be interesting.</p>
