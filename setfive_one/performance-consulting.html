<h3>Performance Consulting</h3>
<p>
  Slow website giving you the blues? We'll analyze your architecture and identify key trouble areas for your site's performance.

<p>
  Slow websites suck.
  Google has published a report that a 500ms increase in load time caused a 20% drop in searches and revenue.
  Additionally, Amazon has reported a strong correlation between decreased load times and increased sales.
</p>
<p>
  Websites can run slowly for several reasons. Slow database queries, slow external JavaScript loads,
  and network issues are just a few aspects of your site that we'll analyze.
  Our guys use tools like Firebug with YSlow to try and determine why an individual page is loading slowly.
  They'll also take a look through your MySQL slow_query log to spot SQL queries that are cramping your style.
  We also use curl-loader to analyze how your site will respond to a dramatic increase in visitors, like a Slashdotting. 
</p>
<p>
  In addition to performance tests, we can also analyze how well an application will scale.
  We'll take your application and put it through its paces to see how to provision resources to make it scale.
  We can also do "scaling fire drills" where we see how long it would take to begin supporting additional users.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the day we make things run fast, so if you need a speed boost, drop us a line.
