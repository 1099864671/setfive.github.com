  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <p>
    Our story isn't completely written yet, so bear with us. Setfive Consulting was born out of frustration.
           Our core team was frustrated by incompetent managers forcing them to use the "new sexy" tool, not the right tool.
           The team was fed up by being treated like a bunch of replaceable cogs.
           But above all, they were infuriated by decisions that everyone knew negatively affected the client or customer.
           With these problems in mind, Setfive's core set out to craft something different - something better.
  </p>
  <p>Setfive prides itself on being different.
           First of all, the way we run projects is different.
           Our technical teams are always self managing and agile.
           A lead developer, also acting as a project manager, has full control over what his team uses and how the project is scheduled.
           As a result, our developers are happy, motivated, and productive.
           It is no secret that happy developers produce great code, so we try and keep our guys happy.
           What truly sets us apart from other development firms is that we will never let our customers "fly blind."
           If our guys have a brilliant idea or see an issue in your product, they'll let you know.
           We strongly believe that this helps produce both great products and lasting relationships.
  </p>
  <p>
    So that's our story. We're basically a bunch of creative, motivated, and energetic hackers. </p>

    Most of the team calls Boston home, but there are a couple of us scattered across the US.
