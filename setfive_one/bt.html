  <h3>Boston Technologies</h3>
  <p>Boston Technologies (BT) wanted a team they could count on.</p>
  <p>
    BT started as a company dedicated to producing high performance MetaTrader4 bridges.
    However, as they grew, they began to require an increasing number of web products.
    At this point, BT started seeking out a partner firm for their web development. Enter Setfive.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've worked with BT on several ventures including web applications, Salesforce integrations, and MetaTrader4 customization.
    The web applications we developed for BT have included a system to track FOREX trading performance and an application to
    streamline the tracking of their various servers.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, BT brought us in to integrate several disparate web forms so that they could create
    data in their Salesforce CRM solution. Integrating with Salesforce was an interesting experience for us.
    It allowed us to get a deep understanding of the workflow that sales teams use to convert leads to sales
    and how they respond to support requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working with MetaTrader4 was one of the biggest challenges we've faced at Setfive.
    Buggy program? Check. Lack of server of documentation? Check. An "API" with a 
    debug strategy of "guess and check"? Check. Well sign us up. Despite all of its shortcomings,
    we made MetaTrader4 work for BT's needs.

    Technologies: Symfony framework (PHP), Salesforce API, and MetaTrader4.
