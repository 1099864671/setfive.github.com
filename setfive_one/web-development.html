<h3>Web Application Development</h3>
<p>
  The desktop is dead. We specialize in developing both enterprise and consumer facing web apps.
</p>
<p>
  Web apps are our jam - every one we do comes with an extra large can of whoop ass.
  Our teams go the extra mile to make sure that your application is awesome.
  They'll work with you and your spec to make sure that you end up with the best possible product.
  Our guys will give you feedback and act as a sounding board for new ideas and features.
</p>
<p>
  Generally, we develop the majority of our applications on the LAMP stack using the Symfony framework.
  Our reasoning is simple: LAMP is open source, easy to scale, and is battle tested.
  Developing with Symfony is an easy choice; it reduces development time and helps us produce secure, solid code.
