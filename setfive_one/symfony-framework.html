<h3>Symfony Framework (PHP)</h3>
<p>
  We do Symfony projects. We build 'em, customize 'em, and optimize 'em.
</p>

<p>
  Symfony is our jam.
  We've spent hours arguing about the merits of using components versus partials,
  the best way to validate Symfony forms, and our favorite Symfony plugins.
  Between them, our team has architected, built, and launched over a dozen Symfony applications.
  If you have an existing Symfony project, our guys will be able to figure it out.
</p>

<p>
  If your original development team disappeared, we'll be able to take an existing
  Symfony application and add features or fix bugs.
  Just remember, you aren't alone in holding an application that no one understands.
</p>

<p>
  We really like to hold Symfony boot camps.
  We'll take a team of PHP developers and bring them up to speed on Symfony.
  Your guys will get exposed to Symfony's core strengths as well as some of its more advanced features.
  Additionally, our team will share some war stories and personal anecdotes about Symfony's quirks and gotchas.
  We can also work up a presentation to convince the "suits" that Symfony is the right tool for the job.
