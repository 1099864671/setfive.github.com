    Tufts University needed help. Fast.

  <p>
    When we started talking,
    they were using a static visualization solution that only allowed a certain amount of data to be displayed.
    We all agreed that this was unacceptable, and we began searching for alternatives.
    After we ruled out 3D holographic projections,
    we settled on keeping their current map (yeah, we dig maps) intact but modifying how the data was served.
    Our solution involved building a custom administration backend for Tufts to control the data, as well as
    changing how the data was integrated into their current mapping solution.

  <p>
    Our RAD team successfully transitioned Tufts from a limited, static solution to one that is dynamic and user friendly.
