  <h3>Technology</h3>
  <p>
    We use the good stuff. Our teams use whatever they feel is appropriate for the task at hand. But as a generalization here is a start:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><abbr title="Linux Apache MySQL PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack  - It's solid. Open source, heavily deployed, and portable.</li>
      <li>Symfony Framework (PHP) - It boosts productivity, encourages best practices, and stays out of the way.</li>
      <li><abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr> - Corporate made us do it. But seriously, AJAX kicks ass, page reloads are so 2001.</li>
      <li>Adobe Flex - Our weapon of choice for RIAs. Flash is everywhere, which means Flex is too.</li>
      <li>Whiteboards - The dry erase markers kept staining our LCDs.</li>
    </ul>
