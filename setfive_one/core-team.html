      Ashish is a seasoned software developer.
      He has written software targeting both the desktop and internet and hopes to make an impact in the mobile space.
      Recently, the majority of Ashish's experience has been focused on creating feature rich web applications.
      His tools of choice are PHP and jQuery along with a healthy serving of whoop ass.
      Additionally, Ashish is a bit of a geek - he'll talk till he is blue in the face about the merits of AJAX
      over Flash or how PHP's lack of closures is a killer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Away from the office, Ashish is a sometimes avid runner (hey, Boston is cold) and gym rat.
      He also craft brews with Matt and hopes to be the brew master at the Setfive Brewery one day.
