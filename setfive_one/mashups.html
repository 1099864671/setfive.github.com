<h3>Mashups</h3>
<p>
  Not to sound clich&#233;, but nothing says "web 2.0" like a mashup. Google, Twitter, and Foursquare - we rock them all.

  Mashups are awesome. Nothing like taking some data from here, mashing it into some from there, and then remixing it with a totally different service - sweet.
  We've worked with several of Google's APIs, the Twitter API, and several of Yahoo's services.
  If you want to mash, we'll be able to hook it up.
