<h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
<p>
  The hardest part of building a great product is often the first iteration.
</p>

<p>
  Lots of people have awesome ideas, but the secret sauce is the execution.
  Our RAD teams bring the secret sauce. They'll take your idea and quickly
  move through several iterations until you have a usable prototype.
  This prototype will give your idea "life" and let you get a general look
  and feel for how things will work. If you like how the prototype is working
  out, our guys will continue development until you have a finished product.
  From a technology standpoint, we like doing mockups with Balsamic and
  then moving to either Adobe Flex or HTML for more functional prototypes. 
</p>

<p>
  So if you have a great idea but don't know where to start, give us a shout, and we'll put a team together.
