  <h3>The MFA</h3>
  <p>
  The MFA came to us with a unique problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    They had an application running proprietary code which, as they added more data, was becoming increasingly unusable.
    The team that originally built the application had disappeared so we were left with a difficult choice
     - struggle to modernize the old app or innovate something new with the possibility of losing data.
     After some thought, we decided to meet them half way. The plan was to build a new application and import the old data.
  </p>
  <p>
    After some button mashing, everything started to come together.
    We successfully transitioned an ad-hoc Flash solution to use the Google Maps API.
    Our solution was a more responsive and more maintainable upgrade over their previous software.
    We're excited to continue working with the MFA to develop engaging and inventive applications.
